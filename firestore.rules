/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ClickSync application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with counters stored in the /users/{userId}/counters/{counterId} subcollection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents and counters.
 * - Listing other users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on the path-based userId to authorize access. The `userId` is implicitly denormalized into the document paths,
 * allowing for simple and efficient security checks.
