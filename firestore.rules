/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ClickSync application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 * The global counter is publicly readable but can only be modified by authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user data.
 * - /counters/main_counter: A single document for the global click count.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Listing other users is not permitted.
 * - Anyone can read the main counter.
 * - Only authenticated users can increment the main counter.
