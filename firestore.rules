/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ClickSync application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/counters/{counterId}: Counters belonging to a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own documents.
 * - Listing other users is not permitted.
 * - A user can manage their own counters, but not the counters of others.
